//Aim:Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded constructor initializes employee details.The default constructor should Initialize name as "Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the name and sets a default salary.  Create a method DisplayEmployeeDetails() to display employee information.
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;
    public Employee() {
        this.name = "Unknown";  
        this.salary = 0;        
    }

    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name; 
        this.salary = 30000; 
    }
    public void DisplayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: $" + salary);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp1 = new Employee();
        emp1.DisplayEmployeeDetails();

        System.out.println(); 
        Employee emp2 = new Employee("John Doe");
        emp2.DisplayEmployeeDetails();
    }
}


//output:
Employee Name: Unknown
Employee Salary: $0.0

Employee Name: John Doe
Employee Salary: $30000.0
